comment: "Abstract: (APS)This paper gives the results of a study of single-pion production\
  \ by the weak charged current utilizing the wide-band muon-type-neutrino beam at\
  \ the Argonne Zero Gradient Synchrotron. The data were obtained from hydrogen and\
  \ deuterium fillings of the 12-ft bubble chamber. The methods of event selection\
  \ and separation from background are given as are the details of the corrections\
  \ and systematic effects in the data sample. The energy-dependent cross sections\
  \ and differential distributions are presented for the three single-pion production\
  \ reactions \u03BDp\u2192\u03BC\u2212p\u03C0+, \u03BDn\u2192\u03BC\u2212p\u03C0\
  0, and \u03BDn\u2192\u03BC\u2212n\u03C0+. An isospin decomposition shows that the\
  \ ratio of I=12 to I=32 amplitudes is 0.68\xB10.04 with a relative phase of (90.7\xB1\
  4.6)\xB0 for M(N\u03C0)<1.4 GeV. This agrees with theoretical models, particularly\
  \ the detailed calculation of Adler. Using the data of the reaction \u03BDp\u2192\
  \u03BC\u2212p\u03C0+, the characteristic mass of the nucleon axial-vector elastic\
  \ form factor is measured to be 0.98\u22120.03+0.06 GeV when analyzed within the\
  \ context of the Adler model. The data are also compared to other parametrizations\
  \ of the nucleon axial-vector form factor."
