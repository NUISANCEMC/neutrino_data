comment: "Abstract: (APS)This paper reports a determination of the axial-vector form\
  \ factor of the nucleon using the momentum-transfer distribution for 1737 events\
  \ of the type \u03BD\u03BCd\u2192\u03BC\u2212pps. The events were obtained from\
  \ a 2.4\xD7106-frame exposure of the Argonne 12-foot bubble chamber to a neutrino\
  \ beam at the Argonne Zero Gradient Synchrotron. After fitting and applying selection\
  \ criteria, the background was estimated to be at the 2% level. The axial-vector\
  \ mass in the dipole parametrization was measured to be MA=1.00\xB10.05 GeV/c2,\
  \ in good agreement both with earlier measurements from this experiment and with\
  \ other recent results. A test of the conserved-vector-current hypothesis, made\
  \ by simultaneously fitting MA and MV using dipole form factors, gave MA=0.80\xB1\
  0.10 GeV/c2 and MV=0.96\xB10.04 GeV/c2."
